Hi, my name is Nick Ward.

I've set this page and blog up so I can record what I'm working on and my thoughts in general.

As I write this, COVID-19 has us all cooped up inside. I've been trying to spend my time improving myself and learning new skills. It's a long journey, but I hope this blog helps me along.

Thanks for reading,
Nick.
