I'm Nick Ward. 

Currently a backend software developer working in Toronto for IBM. Professionally I try and make [Db2](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/db2) run fast, but I probably won't talk about that much here.

Trying to learn new things and take on new challenges. I've recently been interested in emulation, javascript, node.js, webassembly, Go, and Rust.

My online handle is usually narwhaldisco. It looks random, but it's because narwhaldisco is an anagram for Nicholas Ward. Chainsaw Lord is also an anagram for Nicholas Ward, but I'm probably not extreme enough for that name.

Outside technology I like pop punk rock music, camping, hiking, tacos and cats.
